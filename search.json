High Performance Computing Hearty Pork Chili\n\nWhy do we use HPC resources in the biological sciences?\n\n Biology is too easy, so we need to keep ourselves occupied by learning other skills. If we analyze data on our laptops, we won't be able to use them to watch cat videos. Typical consumer-grade computers don't have enough computing power to handle many large datasets."
